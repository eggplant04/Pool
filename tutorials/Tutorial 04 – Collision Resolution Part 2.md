# Tutorial – Collision Response: Circle to Circle

## Introduction and Objective:
In this tutorial, we’ll combine the collision resolution function we wrote in the previous tutorial with our existing collision detection code so that we can simulate two circles colliding and bouncing off each other.

# Prerequisites:
We will be using the DIY Physics engine that you have been writing.
Ensure you have completed the following tutorials:
- ***Tutorial 01 - Fixed Timestep*** – *a version is also available in the* ***Create a Physics Engine - Fixed Timestep*** *Tutorial page on canvas.*

- ***Tutorial 03 - Collision Detection*** – *a version is also available in the*  ***Create a Physics Engine - Collision Detection*** *Tutorial page on canvas.*
- ***Tutorial 04 - Collision Resolution Part 1*** – *a version is also available in the*  ***Create a Physics Engine - Collision Resolution*** *Presentation page on canvas.*

Although recommended, it is not necessary to have completed the following previous tutorials:

- ***Tutorial 03.1 - Projectile Physics Part 2*** – *a version is also available in the*  ***Things You Should Know - Projectile Physics 2*** *Presentation page on canvas.*

## Circle-to-Circle Collision:
In the Collision Detection tutorial we implemented the *Circle2Circle()* function inside the *PhysicsScene* class to detect collisions between two circles.

``` c++
bool PhysicsScene::Circle2Circle(PhysicsObject* obj1, PhysicsObject* obj2)
{
	Circle *circle1 = dynamic_cast<Circle*>(obj1);
	Circle *circle2 = dynamic_cast<Circle*>(obj2);
	if (circle1 != nullptr && circle2 != nullptr) {
		glm::vec2 dist = circle1->GetPosition() - circle2->GetPosition();
		if (glm::length(dist) < circle1->GetRadius() + circle2->GetRadius()){
			// collision
			// for now, just stop the circles
			circle1->SetVelocity(glm::vec2(0, 0));
			circle2->SetVelocity(glm::vec2(0, 0));
			return true;
		}
	}
	return false;
}
```

Because we had yet to write the collision response function, when two circles collided we simply set the velocity of both circles to (0,0).

The *ResolveCollision()* function we added to the *Rigidbody* class during the last tutorial will modify the velocities of both circles in response to a collision event.


Update the *Circle2Circle()* function so that it calls the *ResolveCollision()* function on one of the circles, passing in the other circle as an argument.

## Activity 1: Billiard Ball Simulation

The [lecture slides for this session](https://aie.instructure.com/courses/1493/pages/physics-for-games-collision-resolution-sphere-to-sphere) discuss the following situation using billiard balls:
- The cue ball’s (A) speed is 11.11 m/s (40 km/hr), going east, ball 2 (B) is stationary
- The cue ball weighs 170g, numbered balls 160g
- The coefficient of elasticity is 1
- The collision normal is (-1, 0)
	- The cue ball’s velocity points directly towards the numbered ball’s centre, so the normal will point directly back.

Create a simulation that reproduces this problem.

Run your simulation and use breakpoints to check if the velocities of your circles after the collision match the expected velocities in the worked problem in the lecture slides. If you’ve used a different velocity and mass for either of your circles, work through the math yourself to double check the results of your simulation.

In both of the example problems presented in the lecture slides, the collision normal has been calculated for you. You will find that the collision normal calculated by your collision resolution function will match the values listed in the slides.

Simulate the second example presented in the lecture slides (one ball bouncing off another at an angle). Again, check your simulation against the final velocities listed in the lecture slides.

## Kinetic Energy Diagnostics:
It can be difficult to visually diagnose whether a physics simulation is behaving correctly. It’s helpful at this stage to add some objective and unambiguous diagnostics.

With an elasticity of 1, our collision should conserve both momentum and kinetic energy. We are guaranteed to conserve momentum because we’re modifying the velocities using *RigidBody::ApplyForceToActor*. This applies equal and opposite forcers to the two bodies and thus conserves momentum. 

We should check that kinetic energy is also being preserved.

Add a function to *Rigidbody* to calculate the kinetic energy. For now this will just be linear kinetic energy, calculated as ***Ek = ½ mv²***

Use this function to calculate the kinetic energy before and after the collision, and check that the values are approximately equal. (There will be very small differences due to the limits of floating point accuracy.)

Here’s an example of checking the kinetic energy before and after a collision:

``` c++
void Rigidbody::ResolveCollision(Rigidbody* actor2)
{
	glm::vec2 normal = glm::normalize(actor2->GetPosition() - m_position);
	glm::vec2 relativeVelocity = actor2->GetVelocity() - m_velocity;

	// if the objects are already moving apart, we don't need to do anything
	if (glm::dot(normal, relativeVelocity) >= 0)
		return;

	float elasticity = 1;
	float j = glm::dot(-(1 + elasticity) * (relativeVelocity), normal) /
		((1 / m_mass) + (1 / actor2->GetMass()));

	glm::vec2 force = normal * j;

	float kePre = GetKineticEnergy() + actor2->GetKineticEnergy();

	ApplyForceToActor(actor2, -force);

	float kePost = GetKineticEnergy() + actor2->GetKineticEnergy();

	float deltaKE = kePost - kePre;
	if (deltaKE > kePost * 0.01f)
		std::cout << "Kinetic Energy discrepancy greater than 1% detected!!";
}
```

Later on in the tutorials, when we introduce variable elasticity, you’ll probably want to remove this check. But for now, it’s a good idea to build a “perfect” physics engine first with full elasticity and no friction, so that we can make sure that conservation of energy is being obeyed.
